In the upcoming subsections, we begin by briefly defining the continuous-time
quantum walk model. We outline its transport properties, encompassing perfect
state transfer, survival probability, statistical aspects, and the quantum
walk-based search algorithm. We conclude by specifying stochastic quantum walks
using Lindblad operators.
