In the upcoming subsections, we begin by briefly defining the continuous-time
quantum walk model. We outline its transport properties, encompassing perfect
state transfer, survival probability, statistical aspects, and the quantum
walk-based search algorithm. We conclude by specifying stochastic quantum walks
using Lindblad operators.

%    \item \textcolor{red}{Jaime - Since we do not go into as much detail for transport in the
%        stochastic QW as we do with the CTQW, im going to reorder this section
%        so that we dont give the impression that our transport definitions and
%    searching also apply to the stochastic.}

%In the upcoming subsections, we briefly define the two main models of quantum
%walks implemented in our package: continuous-time quantum walks and stochastic
%quantum walks utilizing Lindblad operators. Throughout the subsections we
%present a comprehensive set of definitions of their transport properties,
%including but not limited to aspects like perfect state transfer, survival
%probability, and statistical aspects, as well as the quantum walk-based
%searching algorithm.
