The continuous-time random walk model \cite{montrollweiss1965} on a graph is a
Markov process where transitions have a fixed probability per unit time,
$\gamma$, of moving to adjacent vertices. Consider a graph $G$ with $N$
vertices and no self-loops, this walk can be defined by the linear differential
equation that describes the probability of jumping to a connected vertex at any
given time 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = \gamma \sum_j L_{ij} p_j(t), \label{eq:classicalContWalk}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the Laplacian defined as $L = A - D$, and $p_j(t)$ is the
time-dependent probability associated with each vertex transition. $A$ is the
adjacency matrix that represents each vertex connection, given by
\begin{equation}
	A_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1, & \mbox{if } (i,j)\in G \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise,} \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and D is the diagonal matrix $D_{jj} = deg(j)$ corresponding to the
degree %\footnote{The degree of a vertex refers to the number of edges that it is connected to.} 
of vertex $j$.\par

Analogously, Schrödinger's equation describes the quantum version of the walk 
%The Schrödinger's equation will describe the
%continuous-time quantum walk model equation
\begin{equation}
	i\hbar \frac{d\ket{\psi(t)}}{dt} = H \ket{\psi(t)}, \label{shrodinger}
\end{equation}
where $H = -\gamma L$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, or simply $H = -\gamma
A$. This operator can be defined either as a time-independent Laplacian or
adjacency matrix without loss of generality. Considering $\hbar = 1$, the
solution of the continuous-time quantum walk will be

%adjacency matrix, as well as without loss of generality $\hbar = 1$, the
%solution of the continuous-time quantum walk will be 
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi(t)} = U(t)\ket{\psi(0)}.
    \label{eq:ctqwSystemEvolution}
\end{equation}
where $\psi(0)$ is a compatible initial condition and the unitary matrix $U(t)$
is
\begin{equation}
	U(t) = e^{-iHt} = e^{i(\gamma L)t} = e^{i\gamma(A-D)t}.

A brief look at Figure \ref{fig:contdist0} highlights key properties of the
quantum walk. Contrary to the classical scenario, where the probability of
finding the walker is predominantly concentrated around the origin with a
standard deviation scaling as $\sqrt{t}$ (termed \textit{diffuse} propagation),
the quantum walk exhibits \textit{ballistic} propagation, proportional to $t$. Here, the probability
peaks away from the origin, and the standard deviation grows linearly with time
\cite{childs2002}, indicating a quadratic advantage in the quantum case.

%For a more detailed visualization, this quantum walk model was coded in Python,
%and Figure \ref{fig:contdist0} was obtained by setting the transition rate to
%$\gamma=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}$ and the initial condition to $\ket{\psi(0)} =
%\ket{0}$.  A brief look at Figure \ref{fig:contdist0} reveals several
%similarities to previous models. The property of having two peaks away from the
%origin and low probability near the origin is present across all the quantum
%walks. However, a symmetric initial condition is not required in the continuous
%case.\par

% A general state of a system $\ket{\psi(t)}$ can be written as a function of
% its complex amplitudes 
% \begin{equation}
% 	q_i = \braket{i|\psi(t)},
% \end{equation}
% which means equation \eqref{shrodinger} can be rewritten as 
% \begin{equation}
% 	i\hbar \frac{dq_i(t)}{dt} = \sum_j H_{ij} q_j(t).
% 	\label{eq:contWalkShrod}
% \end{equation}
% Comparing equations \eqref{eq:contWalkShrod} and \eqref{eq:classicalContWalk},
% the Laplacian is replaced by the Hamiltonian and the probabilities by
% amplitudes. One of the main differences is the complex phase $i$, which will
% result in very different behavior.  Setting $\hbar = 1$ and solving the
% differential equation results in the evolution operator of this walk 
% \begin{equation}
% 	U(t) = e^{-iHt} = e^{i(\gamma L)t} = e^{i\gamma(A-D)t},
% \end{equation}
% In the regular graph case, where $D$ is simply the degree of the graph
% multiplied by the identity matrix, $A$ and $D$ will commute, meaning that the
% evolution operator can be written in terms of the adjacency matrix 
% \begin{equation}
% 	U(t) = e^{i\gamma A t - i\gamma D t} = e^{i\gamma A t} e^{-i\gamma D t} = \phi(t) e^{i\gamma A t},
% 	\label{eq:contSimulUniOp}
% \end{equation}
% since the degree matrix becomes a global phase. In a uni-dimensional
% quantum system, each vertex will have at most two other neighboring vertices
% and the Hamiltonian can be written as

% \begin{equation}
% 	H_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
% 		2\gamma, & \mbox{if } i= j; \\ 
% 		-\gamma, & \mbox{if } i\neq j\mbox{ and adjacent};\\
% 		0, & \mbox{if } i\neq j\mbox{ and not adjacent}.
% 	\end{cases}
% \end{equation}\par
