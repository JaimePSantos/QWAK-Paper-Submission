This section outlines the capabilities of the \texttt{QWAK} package through
specific use cases. Firstly, we examine PST in 4D hypercube graphs. Secondly,
we focus on the transport properties of CTQWs in directed graphs. Further, we
discuss how \texttt{QWAK} can be employed for quantum search algorithms on
various graph types, namely complete graphs, hypercubes and the Erdős-Rényi
model. Lastly, we look at stochastic quantum walks for navigating perfect mazes
and examine the impact of noise. Each subsection provides hands-on examples,
demonstrating how to leverage the \texttt{QWAK} package for these
applications.\par

Note that all of the following examples can be found in the Notebook directory
of the \texttt{GitHub} repository
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JaimePSantos/QWAK/tree/main/Notebook}}, and the
code examples assume the user has \texttt{NumPy} and \texttt{NetworkX}
imported.
