The study of quantum systems programmatically has offered novel approaches to
many different problems, highlighting speedups to established classical
algorithms. In this paper, we explore continuous-time and stochastic quantum
walks. Recognizing a gap in accessible tools for modern platforms, we present
the \texttt{QWAK} package, developed in \texttt{Python 3}, providing
researchers with a simple but effective tool for quantum walk simulation, their
transport properties and applications. Given that our CTQW evolution relies on
graphs, packages like \texttt{NetworkX} offer powerful yet intuitive 
methods for investigating quantum walks over generalized structures - a domain
with numerous unresolved questions.


Moving forward, we plan to enhance the package in a few different ways.
Planned features include support for CTQW with multiple walkers, refined
visualization tools, and a seamless integration of stochastic quantum walks
into the graphical user interface.  Additionally, we plan to enhance
performance-intensive routines by exploiting GPU capabilities with packages
like \texttt{CuPy}, as well as refining the \texttt{checkPST} method and the
\texttt{StochasticQWAK} class implementations, ensuring \texttt{QWAK} remains
competitive among quantum walk simulation solutions.
