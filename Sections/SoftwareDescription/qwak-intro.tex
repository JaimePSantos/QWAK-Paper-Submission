In this section, we introduce an object-oriented Python package for unitary
continuous-time quantum walks and their generalizations, stochastic quantum
walks. A user-friendly graphical interface is provided, created with
\texttt{HTML}, \texttt{CSS}, and \texttt{JavaScript}, allowing users to study
quantum walks without coding knowledge. Users can define custom graphs or use
pre-defined structures from \texttt{NetworkX}. The backend is constructed using
\texttt{Flask} and \texttt{PyMongo}.\par

We describe the \texttt{QWAK}
package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JaimePSantos/QWAK}}, including
installation, dependencies, implementation, and basic usage. The section
concludes with an overview of the graphical interface and future work.
