In this subsection, we delve into three quantum walk facets essential to our
package. We first outline key statistical measures such as mean, standard
deviation, inverse participation ratio, and survival probability.  Lastly, we
examine perfect state transfer and relevant literature findings.

%In this section, we explore three key aspects of our quantum walk simulation
%package. Firstly, we define some important statistical measures, including
%mean, standard deviation, inverse participation ratio, and survival
%probability. Secondly, we investigate perfect state transfer, as well as some
%results in literature. Lastly, we discuss the searching algorithm based on the
%continuous-time quantum walk in graphs, highlighting its practical
%computational applications.
